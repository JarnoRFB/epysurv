class GLRNegativeBinomial(STSBasedAlgorithm):
    """
    Generalized likelihood ratio algorithm using negative binomial distribution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    alpha
        The (known) dispersion parameter of the negative binomial distribution,
        i.e. the parametrization of the negative binomial is such that the variance
        is mean + alpha ∗ mean2. Note: This parametrization is the inverse of
        the shape parametrization used in R – for example in dnbinom and glr.nb.
        Hence, if alpha=0 then the negative binomial distribution boils down to
        the Poisson distribution and a call of algo.glrnb is equivalent to a call to
        algo.glrpois. If alpha=NULL the parameter is calculated as part of the
        in-control estimation. However, the parameter is estimated only once from
        the first fit. Subsequent fittings are only for the parameters of the linear
        predictor with alpha fixed.
    glr_test_threshold
        Threshold in the GLR test, i.e. cγ.
    m
        Number of time instances back in time in the window-limited approach, i.e. the last value considered is max(1, n − m).
        To always look back until the first observation use -1.
    change
        A string specifying the type of the alternative. The two choices are "intercept" and "epi".
    direction
        Specifying the direction of testing in GLR scheme.
        - ("inc",) only increases in x are considered in the GLR-statistic
        - ("dec",) only decreases are regarded
        - ("inc", "dec") both increases and decreases are regarded.
    upperbound_statistic
        A string specifying the type of upperbound-statistic that is returned.
        - "cases" for the number of cases that would have been necessary to produce an alarm
        - "value" for the GLR-statistic
    x_max
        Maximum value to try for x to see if this is the upperbound number of cases before sounding an alarm (Default: 1e4).
        This only applies only when ``upperbound_statistic == "cases"``.
